> __**Starting Vorago**__

This guide is a short summary of knowledge required for your first few Normal Mode kills. To read up on in-depth explained mechanics and strategy guides, refer to the respective topic in #index.

The following steps are only required if you have never been to Vorago before and only need to be done **once**.

• Enter the borehole north of Falador and jump past all gaps
• Talk to Vorago and go through all available chat options
• Once you receive a message asking you to confirm fighting Vorago, decline it

__Challenging Vorago:__

• Joining a fight at Vorago will start with every team member taking variable typeless damage up to `12,500` each player
• Boost your life points above `12,500` in order to pass the entry hit (T90 shield, bonfire $bonfire and eat a Rocktail Soup $soup)
• The Powerburst of Vitality $vitality can be utilised shortly before the entry hit (drink it ~ 15 seconds after challenging)

__Setup:__

Some items are useless at Vorago, refer to #presets for an overview of what to take and adjust the examples to your needs. Preset example:

.Basic Attacks

> __**Vorago's Basic Attacks**__

Vorago has 2 different basic attacks: Blue Bombs $blue and melee Swipes $swipe. Sometimes both happen at the same time. Blue Bombs are guaranteed if the primary target (Base Tank) is not in melee distance. Generally speaking, the Base Tank vokes $voke Vorago and takes melee Swipes and the Bomb Tank stays farther out to receive all Blue Bombs $blue.

• $swipe Melee Swipes can splash and they affect a 2 tile radius around the primary target, as well as anyone surrounding Vorago in melee distance
• $blue Blues are sent to the farthest player (Bomb Tank), can not splash and deal magic damage in a 3 tile radius
• $red Red Bombs cancel most defensive abilities and deal typeless damage of `2,000`, increasing for every player close to their target (Reds sometimes target a random player)
• Reds are best dealt by moving away from the rest of your team

__Positioning:__

• Pay attention to AOE damage surrounding the Base and Bomb Tank (keep in mind to stay closer to Vorago than the Bomb Tank)

.Phase Breakdown

> __**Phase Breakdown**__

Every phase has unique mechanics and conditions to defeat Vorago. In phases 2 and 4 the life points will keep resetting to `75,000` until specific mechanics have been passed.

• $maulpiecea Phase 1: Vorago can be killed once the Top Lure jumps (reference: #climbing)
• $maulpieceb Phase 2: Four gravity orbs $gravity must be tagged to proceed with Bring Him Down, after which Vorago can be killed
• $blue Phase 3: Vorago dies once reaching `0` life points
• $red Phase 4: Three waterfalls $waterfall have to be passed
• $maul Phase 5: Vorago has to be pushed to the east and can then be defeated by using the Maul of Omens (reference: #maul)

.Weekly Special Mechanics
> __**Weekly Special Mechanics**__

While phases 1 and 2 remain the same at all times, the Phases 3 to 5 depend on the current Rotation (also known as the Weekly Special mechanic). The amount of autos between mechanics varies from $auto 3 to 5 depending on the Rotation. There are 6 rotations in total, changing weekly. The rotation changes every Wednesday at 00:00 game-time:

• $ceil #ceilings
• $scop #scopulus
• $vitalis #vitalis
• $green #green-bomb
• $ts #team-split
• $purple #the-end

.Phase 1
> __**Phase 1**__

$red Red Bomb ➔ $auto 4 auto attacks ➔ $repeat repeat

The Phase ends once the climber jumps and Vorago is killed.

.Phase 2
> __**Phase 2**__

$bleed 5 Bleeds ➔ $auto 3 auto attacks ➔ $link Reflect ➔ $auto 3 auto attacks ➔ $red Red Bomb ➔ $auto 4 auto attacks ➔ $repeat repeat

• $bleed Bleeds: Vorago smashes the ground, inflicting a melee Bleed $bleed to the player which cancels most defensive abilities
• If a bleed is not cleared before another is applied, the player will take `6,000` typeless damage
• $link Reflect: Vorago links to a random player for **9.6** seconds, channeling all incoming damage towards them. Stop attacking during reflects

The Base, Bomb Tank and TL5 deal with bleeds $bleed and Reds $red until the 4th Gravity Field $gravity is activated. At this point, Vorago progresses with the Bring Him Down mechanic (reference: #overview). Spam-click Vorago and deal damage with 1 - 2 thresholds until the fight phases.

If you happen to receive a Bleed $bleed, simply use Freedom $freedom to clear it. To read an in-depth explanation, refer to #clearing-bleeds.

.Phase 3
> __**Phase 3**__

Weekly Special Mechanic ➔ $auto 3 or 5 auto attacks ➔ $link Reflect ➔ $auto 3 auto attacks ➔ Weekly Special mechanic ➔ $auto 3 or 5 auto attacks ➔ $repeat repeat

There's no condition to phase Vorago other than killing him. Once he reaches 0 HP, the next phase will start.

.Phase 4
> __**Phase 4**__

$waterfall Waterfall ➔ $auto 3 auto attacks ➔ $vitalis Stone Clone ➔ $auto 7 auto attacks ➔ Weekly Special mechanic ➔ $auto 3 or 5 auto attacks ➔ $bleed 5 Bleeds ➔ $auto 3 auto attacks ➔ $link Reflect ➔ $auto 3 auto attacks ➔ $repeat repeat

• $waterfall Waterfall: Vorago charges a high-hitting explosion, cancelling most defensive abilities
• The explosion can be avoided by moving behind the spawned Waterfall (a randomly selected corner of the arena)
• $vitalis Stone Clone: Vorago performs an attack visually similar to a melee Swipe $swipe, cloning a random player
• If you receive a Stone Clone, kill it (nobody besides the cloned player can deal damage to it)

.Phase 5
> __**Phase 5**__

Weekly Special mechanic ➔ $auto 3 or 5 auto attacks ➔ $link Reflect ➔ $auto 3 auto attacks ➔ $bleed 3 Bleeds ➔ $auto 3 auto attacks ➔ $repeat repeat

In Phase 5 the goal is to push Vorago to the edge on the East side of the arena and finish him off with the Maul of Omens $maul (reference: #maul).

• Deal damage to Vorago in order to push him forward (push forwards)
• Upon Vorago dealing damage to players, he pushes the other direction backwards (push backwards)

While the Bomb Tank (orange) positions in the north-west at the northern wall of the arena, all remaining players (green) should move to the south-east at the southern wall. Do not stay in melee distance to Vorago in order to avoid melee Swipes $swipe.

__Bleeds:__

Just like in preceding phases, Vorago applies Bleeds in Phase 5. There exist several methods of clearing them in this phase. To read an in-depth explanation, refer to #clearing-bleeds.

• Freedom $freedom immediately clears any applied bleeds
• A Bleed is also cleared by moving 7 tiles away from where it was applied. You can use Escape $escape, Bladed Dive $bd, Surge $surge and Barge $gbarge to clear them.
