.entryhit
> __**Entry Hit**__

If you have never been to Vorago before, check out our #basic-guide.

• Challenging Vorago will open a chat prompt for all players located in the starting area, asking to join the fight
• **20 seconds** after Vorago is challenged, your team will be hit `50,000` typeless damage (`70,000` in Hard Mode)
• The entry hit is split between all players that joined the challenge, capped at `12,500` each player (`14,000` in Hard Mode)
• Challenging in Normal Mode with 5 players results in everyone taking `10,000` damage

.attacks
> __**Auto Attacks**__

Vorago has 2 different basic attacks: Blue Bombs $blue and melee Swipes $swipe. When the person holding Vorago's aggression (the Base Tank) stays in melee distance, there is a 50% chance for Vorago to trigger each of his Auto Attacks. Vorago can fire both a Blue Bomb and use a Swipe in the same action. If the Base Tank does not stay in melee distance, Vorago throws a Blue Bomb guaranteed.

__Blue Bomb:__

• Damage type: **Magic** $deflectmagic
• Affected area: **3 tile radius** (7x7 area)
• Blue Bombs can **not** splash
• Vorago always fires the Blue Bomb $blue to the player farthest away within his attack range
• With 11 or more players in Normal Mode or at any team size in Hard Mode, Vorago fires two Blue Bombs at once

__Melee Swipe:__

• Damage type: **Melee** $deflectmelee
• Affected area: **2 tile radius** (5x5 area) around the main target **and in melee distance** (area of 7x7 tiles from Vorago's center)
• Swipes can splash
• Vorago performs a Swipe $swipe to his primary target (Base Tank)

.reds
> __**Red Bomb**__

At the Red Bomb $red attack Vorago fires both a **Non-Homing Blue Bomb** $blue and a Red Bomb to the player farthest away within attack range, cancelling most defensive abilities and setting them on a short cooldown. There is an approximately **10% chance** that the Red Bomb targets a **randomly selected player** instead. In Normal Mode you receive a chat warning: "Vorago has sent a bomb after you. Run!".

For a strategy on how to deal with Red Bombs refer to #cade-cept.

__Non-Homing Blue Bomb:__

• In most aspects, this bomb behaves exactly like the normal attack Blue Bomb $blue
• It targets the player's location at the time of launching, instead of tracing the player
• The Non-Homing Blue Bomb always hits before the Red Bomb (can be resonanced $resonance)
• You can avoid damage by running away right after the Red Bomb $red has been launched

.
__Red Bomb:__

• Damage type: **Typeless**
• Affected area: **2 tile radius** (5x5 area)
• Damage dealt: `2,000` increasing by `1,000` for every player within a 5 tile radius (11 x 11 area), capping at `7,000`
• Scaled damage in Hard Mode: `3,000` increasing by `1,500` for every player within a 5 tile radius (11 x 11 area), capping at `10,500`
• Cancelled abilities: $resonance $devo $reflect $debil $cade $immortality

.bleeds
> __**Bleeds**__

Vorago smashes his main target with both hands inflicting a Bleed $bleed on them dealing `1,200` melee damage every other tick (`3,000` in Hard Mode) and resetting all defensive abilities. Shield Dome $dome can be used to reduce the damage over time of a Bleed.

For strategies on how to clear bleeds properly refer to #clearing-bleeds.

• Bleeds show up in the debuff bar with a Dismember $bleed icon
• In phases 2, 3 and 4 (2, 5 and 9 in Hard Mode) Vorago applies 5 Bleeds
• In phase 5 (10 and 11 in Hard Mode) Vorago applies 3 Bleeds
• Vorago will deal `6,000` typeless unblockable damage (`10,000` in Hard Mode) if a second Bleed is received before the previous is cleared
• Damage modifiers such as melee protect will apply and reduce bleed damage over time, but not the typeless unblockable hit
• Bleed damage decreases with higher distance to Vorago clearing at 6 squares away

.reflect
> __**Reflect**__

During the Reflect $link mechanic (also commonly called "Link") Vorago redirects all damage dealt to him to a random player. At the beginning of the mechanic Vorago raises his arm and the linked player will receive a chat warning saying: "Vorago channels incoming damage to you. Beware!". Unaffected players receive the warning: "Vorago reflects incoming damage to nearby foes!". In Hard Mode no chat messages appear.

• Damage type: According to the **player's attack style**
• Damage dealt: **100-200% of the original damage** dealt
• Duration: **16 ticks** / **9.6 seconds**
• Linked targets: **1** or 2 if the team size is greater than 11 (doubled in Hard Mode)
• In Hard Mode both the player attacking and the player linked receive damage
• Reflect $link clears any bleeds and dots applied to Vorago
• Slow hitting abilities are nulled if cast before Reflect start (SGB $sgb, Snipe $snipe and Shadow Tendrils $shadowtendrils are unaffected and deal full damage)

At the end of the mechanic, a swirling green animation occurs around the linked player and the same player will receive a chat warning saying: "Vorago releases his mental link on you.". In Hard Mode, no chat messages appear.

.bhd
> __**Bring Him Down**__

Throughout phase 2 Vorago spawns Gravity Fields $gravity (abbreviation: "Orb") that have to be clicked so that Vorago absorbs them.

__Gravity Fields:__

• Gravity Fields spawn as Vorago starts the Reflect $link mechanic
• Each orb spawns randomly in one of the 9 square grids in the arena
• Every Gravity Field progresses towards destabilizing Vorago in order to break off the second maul piece (b) $maulpieceb (reference: #maul)
• Vorago must be kept in range to Gravity Fields or they can not be activated (reference: #recenter)
• **4 orbs must be tagged** to enter the mechanic **Bring Him Down** (abbreviation: BHD)

.
__Bring Him Down:__

• Vorago $vorago becomes unattackable and the camera changes focus on Vorago
• You will have to fill the bar that appears on top by clicking on Vorago (only one click per tick is registered)
• All players take a `150` typeless bleed (`250` in Hard Mode) until the bar is filled
• $warning Standing beneath Vorago during the clicking part will get you stuck underneath until Vorago dies
• A damage check of `50,000` must be passed - Achieve this with thresholds and basics
• The damage check takes 12.0 seconds (7.8 seconds in Hard Mode)
• Failing the damage check results in a repetition of 2 more Gravity Fields $gravity to be tagged alongside with another Bring Him Down
• Finishing the Bring Him Down mechanic will loosen and drop the second maul piece (b) $maulpieceb

After BHD has been passed Vorago can be killed and progressed to phase 3.

.shatter
__Shatter:__

After unlocking the abilities Storm Shards $shard and Shatter $shatter from the Mazcab ability codex, it is a commonly used strategy to apply as many Storm Shards as possible throughout phases 2 and 4 to then Shatter as you passed Bring Him Down (reference: #mechanics) or after the third Waterfall $waterfall in order to trigger all stacked shards and kill Vorago in the earliest tick possible.

Counting from the first GCD of the damage check, Bring Him Down has a duration of 20 ticks / 12 seconds in **Normal Mode** and 13 ticks / 7.8 seconds in **Hard Mode**. Using Shatter as a slow hitting ability (Range $ranged or Mage $magic from 5+ tiles) will allow you to Shatter 1 tick earlier. Using 6 normal abilities and then 4tick shattering will hit on the correct tick.

.
• $blue Normal Mode

**Melee:** $gbarge ➔ $assault ➔ $cleave ➔ $deci ➔ $sever ➔ $gfury ➔ wait 1 tick ➔ $shatter (fast hitting)

**Ranged:** $snap ➔ $snipe ➔ $grico ➔ 4tick $shatter (slow hitting)

**Mage:** $barrage $wm ➔ $dbreath ➔ $barrage $conc ➔ $shatter (slow hitting)

.rotations
> __**Weekly Specials**__

Every reset after Tuesday the weekly special rotation changes for Vorago. There is a total of 6 rotations: Ceilings $ceil, Scopulus $scop, Vitalis $vitalis, Green Bomb $green, Team Split $ts and The End $purple.

Each of these rotations will affect the mechanics in phases 3, 4 and 5 (phases 9, 10 and 11 in Hard Mode). To read up on the mechanics refer to the following channels:

• $ceil #ceilings
• $scop #scopulus
• $vitalis #vitalis
• $green #green-bomb
• $ts #team-split
• $purple #the-end

.waterfall
> __**Waterfall**__

The Waterfall $waterfall mechanic is unique to phase 4 (phase 9 in Hard Mode) and occurs at all weekly rotations.

• All active defensive abilities are reset
• Vorago charges a blast dealing `9,000` - `10,000` typeless damage (increased by `1,000` in Hard Mode)
• A Waterfall $waterfall appears in a random corner
• Standing behind it will block the blast completely
• Duration: 10.2 seconds (7.8 in Hard Mode)
• After the third Waterfall the last maul piece $maulpiecehandle (reference: #maul) drops on the floor and Vorago can be phased

During the weekly rotation Team Split $ts, the third TS in phase 4 will be bugged. Refer to **Breaking Team Splits** in #team-split.

.clone
> __**Stone Clone**__

This mechanic can be skipped entirely with barely any downsides whatsoever. Reference: #clone-skip

Vorago performs an attack visually similar to a melee Swipe $swipe, cloning random players $vitalis. After this special, Vorago's damage taken is reduced by approximately 80%.

• Stone Clones always spawn three Auto Attacks $blue after a Waterfall $waterfall
• Life points: `10,000`
• Combat style: The **same as their target** used at the time of creation
• One Stone Clone is spawned for every 7 players in the arena (clone count is doubled in Hard Mode)
• The Base Tank never receives a clone
• They can only be damaged by their target or someone who has already killed their clone
• In Hard Mode Stone Clones begin their ability order with stunning the player

.push
> __**Phase 5 Push**__

In phase 5 (in Hard Mode phases 10 and 11) the goal is to push Vorago to the very end of the arena and then finish him off with the Maul Of Omens $maul (reference: #maul). Detailed information about the push mechanic can be found in our advanced strategy guide #zero-linking.

• Deal damage to Vorago in order to push him forward
• Upon Vorago dealing damage he pushes the other direction backwards

__Mechanics Causing Pushback:__

• $blue Blue Bomb damage
• $swipe Melee Swipe damage
• $bleed Bleeds
• $vitalis Vitalis orb explosion & damage dealt by spawned Vitali
• $green Green Bomb (both bridging and explosion damage)
• $purple Purple Bomb hitting others (in Hard Mode it also causes push backwards on the primary target)

.
__Abilities Reducing Pushback:__

• $cade Barricade
• $disrupt Disruption Shield
• $dome Shield Dome
• $debil Debilitate (should never be used)

__Skipping Debilitate on Phase 5:__

Debilitate should be skipped after bleeds because while it does have a chance of blocking pushback, it can negatively impact stall. This is most notable on the Team Split $ts rotation because the person who ultimates relies heavily on his thresholds before Team Split. Not needed in other rotations, however, it may still prevent players from using the full duration of their ultimate. This is the reason why to skip Debilitate $debil and gain more stall, resulting in more DPS uptime.

.
**Without Debilitating:** $blue Blue Bomb ➔ $blue Blue Bomb ➔ first Blue hits and creates stall ➔ second Blue hits and creates stall ➔ $blue Blue Bomb ➔ $ts Team Split ➔ third Blue hits and creates stall (during Team Split)

In the above scenario, Vorago pushes back 3 times and you can only take advantage of 2 times he stalls, 2 of which are 3 ticks apart.

**Using Debilitate:** $blue Blue Bomb ➔ $blue Blue Bomb ➔ first Blue hits ➔ $blue Blue Bomb ➔ second Blue hits and creates stall ➔ $ts Team Split ➔ third Blue hits and creates stall (during Team Split)

Debilitating prevents the first Blue Bomb $blue from stalling Vorago which means that the third Blue gets sent out, allowing the Team Split attack to happen earlier. If you have Disruption Shield $disrupt, it is best to use it on the second blue and use one threshold. If you push Vorago after he sends out the third Blue, you have a chance to take advantage of the stall from the last Blue rather than getting pushed during Team Split.
