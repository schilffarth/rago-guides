Guide written by @Serene, @Celly and @Durmoth.

> __**Trio Normal Mode**__

This guide focuses on Trio Normal Mode Vorago only. This guide won’t explain the basics of Vorago, for those go to #mechanics and #phase-overviewl. The guide is split into three roles: Base Tank, Bomb Tank and TL5. If a Phase, Rotation or role isn’t mentioned on any Phase, it’s because their jobs don’t differ from higher team sizes. For the full strategies on Base and Bomb check #duo.

> __**Top Lure Voke 5 - TL5**__

This role is the primary focus of this guide. The responsibilities of the TL5 are to climb in Phase 1 and lure Vorago him into jump spot, and to take the 5th Bleed $bleed with provoke $voke on every Bleed set throughout Phase 2 to 4 (reference: #clearing-bleeds).
The TL5 always positions farther away from Vorago than the Base Tank and closer than the Bomb Tank (3-4 steps away).
If a Phase doesn’t appear below, it means that the Tl5 needs to do the same as the Base or doesn't have a specific job apart from dpsing.

.guide
> __**Phase 1**__

Climbing reference: #climbing.

The only difference between Phase 1 in Trios compared to 4 man teams, is that the TL5 will receive the Bombs during the climb. This is to allow the Bomb to focus on damage. Bombs are forced on the TL5 when the Base Tank places Vorago West.

• Use Excalibur $excal on dropdown and Vitality $vitality if you’re not doing the Acceleration climb $accel
• Eat to 8,000 HP since you’re getting Blues $blue
• The general idea is: The faster you are, the less damage you’ll take
• In Trios you should jump under 50k HP or right away if there’s a Melee Base
• If you need to drop the piece because you need the inventory space, don't do it until Phase 2 starts		

> __**Phase 2**__

• Provoke $voke after every 4th Bleed $dismember to take 5th one (reference: #clearing-bleeds)
• Activate all Gravity Fields so Base and Bomb can focus on the other mechanics 
• If you’re in charge of dummying Phase 2, drop it before BHD finishes

.
> __**Phase 4**__
• Make sure to pick up at pieces as Phase 4 starts or as Phase 2 ends (reference: #maul)
• Provoke $voke after every 4th Bleed $dismember to take 5th one (reference: #clearing-bleeds)
• At the end of Phase 4, it’s the TL5’s job to pick up all the maul pieces and make the maul $maul before Phase 5 starts
• If you couldn’t pick up the last piece in time, do it right away on Phase 5 so you can ultimate before Vorago appears

> __**Phase 5**__
The Tl5 is expected to do the following for all Phase 5 regardless of the rotation:
• Same as the Base Tank except you're not switching with the BT, you stay as DPS for the whole Phase
• Having the maul $maul ready on dropdown and mauling in time (reference: #maul)
• If there's a Melee Base you must do the Bomb Tank switch instead. Melee Bomb Tanking is not advised
• Let the Melee Base maul $maul due to them being in melee distance for most of the Phase.

> __**Weekly Specials (Rotations)**__
Every Wednesday at 00:00 GT (in-game reset), the weekly special rotation changes for Vorago. There are a total of 6 rotations: Ceilings $ceil Scopulus $scop:, Vitalis $vitalis, Green Bomb $green, Team Split $ts and The End $purple. These rotations will affect the mechanics in Phases 3, 4 and 5.

.ceil
> __**Ceiling Collapse**__

Mechanic breakdown: #ceilings 
 
__Phase 3:__

This phase is FFA-Bomb Tank after Vorago jumps. Since you will be separated from the team, whoever is farther will become the Bomb Tank. This is done to avoid anyone from ditching their ultimates. Be prepared to take Bombs $blue if that happens.
 
__Phase 4:__

Maul pieces $maulpiecea $maulpieceb can be stuck beneath rocks $ceil. Check your minimap to know where the piece is found if you can’t find it. If after breaking the rock you still can’t see it you have to move your camera up and they will appear. Otherwise wait until the next phase as they will be automatically dropped into Phase 5.

__Phase 5:__

Ceilings $ceil Phase 5 shares the same mechanics and strategies with #team-split $ts. For this reason, the strategy for TL5 during this Phase 5 can be found below in the Team Split section.

.scop
> __**Scopulus**__

.

__Phase 3:__

Ice Nihils $nihilice and Ripper Demons $ripper will cause Scopulii $scop to randomly change their target. Avoid using these familiars

• Position at the marked green cross :negative_squared_cross_mark: and DD with the Base Tank
• Provoke $voke immediately if a Scopulus walkis towards the Bomb. To keep their aggression, throw vuln bombs $vbomb at them
• Devotion $devo once the first Scopulus is about to die

__Phase 5:__

Scopulus $scop Phase 5 shares the same mechanics and strategies with #the-end $purple. For this reason, the strategy for TL5 during this Phase 5 can be found below in the The End section.

.vit
> __**Vitalis**__

Mechanic breakdown: #vitalis

Vitalis is considered one of the hardest rotations. If you have done the other rotations properly, this won’t represent an issue, but having some experience is recommended.

$mines Bringing Dominion Mines is highly recommended for Phases 4 and 5!

__Phase 3:__

• Everyone will pick a corner and be in melee distance. Avoid going close to anyone else
• You will receive both Melee swipes $swipe and Blue Bombs $blue during this Phase because everyone is MD
• You must prayer flick them in time $deflectmelee $deflectmage
• During Reflect $link, equip an item via clicking in your inventory. This will make you stop attacking
• You can also click under yourself to OFF if you are more experienced
• This Phase has Bleeds $dismember after the second cycle. If they happen, the the 5th one as usual
• Do not move out of MD at any point during the Phase and __**never**__ go the Vitalis orb on Phase 3

.
__Phase 4:__

• Position yourself in the North-East quadrant (reference: #vitalis)
• Place Dominion Mines $mines at the correct location where the Vitalis orb is launched
• Step into the Vitalis orb explosion. Prioritize killing all spawned Vitali $vitalis right away

__Phase 5:__

As described in the mechanics channel for #vitalis, Vitalii $vitalis occasionally force your active target to switch back to Vorago. This can cause deadly PKs. Be careful your target stays on the Vitalis, and avoid using any AoE abilities if it’s close to Reflect $link.

• Place Dominion Mines close to MD as the Phase starts (place them again whenever they are ready)
• Step back, while following the South wall, to step into the Vitalis orb explosion. Prioritize killing all spawned Vitali 
• After blocking the orb go back to your spot 1-2 steps away from MD and by the South wall

.gb
> __**Green Bomb**__

Mechanic breakdown: #green-bomb 

__Phase 3:__

• Ultimate on dropdown away from everyone else, but in range to not get Bombs $blue
• Tank all Green Bombs $green targeting you by eating above 10,000 HP or use the Powerburst Of Vitality
• Don’t accidentally bounce the Green $green on anyone.
 
__Phase 4:__

• If a Green Bomb is on you, step away from any team members and tank the `10,000`
• You can call if the Bomb $green is on you, so the Bomb Tank can Intercept $cept you to negate the damage from it
 
__Phase 5:__

• Position yourself South as usual, with the difference that whoever gets the Green $green must run North, tank it and then go back South
• Tank the Green Bomb $green if it’s on you. The Bomb Tank should be Intercepting $cept whoever gets it, but you should have enough hp (`10,000`) in case this doesn’t happen

.ts
> __**Team Split**__

Mechanic breakdown: #team-split
 
__General Overview__
• Step into your respective color for each Team Split and go back to your position as soon as possible to avoid dragging Bombs
• This applies to Phases 3 to 5
• Make sure you have at least `8,000` HP if you plan on tanking a Team Split

__Phase 3:__

• If you are using an Ultimate on dropdown, make sure you place it close to Vorago and surge/dive to it after Team Split ends
• Reprisal $reprisal can be used to tank the typeless hit of the Team Split. 
• You can’t Reprisal the first Team Split of Phase 3/5 if you don’t target cycle on dropdown (reference: #target-cycle)
 
__Phase 5:__

• Reprisal $reprisal can be used if you use Target Cycle before the first Team Split spawns (reference: #target-cycle) 
• Position in the South-East (not MD) and Ultimate before Vorago spawns if you are TCing or right after spawn if not TCing
• Use this gif for reference:

> __**The End**__

Mechanic breakdown: #the-end 

__Phase 3:__

• Follow Vorago's arms rotating counterclockwise
• Glitch out of Vorago's arms (reference: #the-end) whenever it’s possible and Ultimate during the 3rd quadrant
• If you don’t glitch out, make sure you pray Mage $deflectmage and stay in melee distance so you don’t get extra damage from the bombs that are being tagged (usually Blues $blue in Trio)

__Phase 4:__

• Follow Vorago's arms rotating counterclockwise
• Stay distanced to the person tagging the Red Bombs $red
 
__Phase 5:__

• Position in the North-East 1 tile away from melee distance
• You can Onslaught $ons on dropdown. If the team is able to push on dropdown, you can Onslaught in MD instead
• Melee Base will go South-East. For non-melee Bases, Base usually goes North and TL5 South instead
