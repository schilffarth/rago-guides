Everyone can edit the information covered in Rago Hub. This guide explains how to get started with contributing to Rago Hub. Alternatively to following this text guide, you can also check out the YouTube walk-through: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbXEFjnrq8w
.

> __**1. Create an account on github**__

• Head to <https://github.com>
• Your username and email account will both be visible, so make sure you do not include any sensitive personal information
• If you have a github account already, it advised to make a new one for contributing to Rago Hub
• If you are using the git CLI, make sure you check your git config `user.name` / `user.email`, as these settings can still expose information

• Head to <https://github.com/schilffarth/rago-guides>

> __**3. Access your copy of the Rago Hub repository**__

• If you are already experienced with the github workflow, you can clone your forked repository and use an editor on your PC
• The structure of the Rago Hub repository imitates the discord server category / text channel structure

.

• To navigate, simply click through folders (categories on the discord server) until you find this guide in the github repository
• This guide can be found under the category / folder `lobby`, labeled `contribute.txt`

Our goal in this tutorial is to add your name to the list at the bottom of this channel.

> __**4. Make your first edits**__

The next step requires Discord developer options to be enabled, so that you can copy your own Discord ID. Open your Discord settings: `Appearance` > `Advanced` > `Developer Mode` > enable Developer Mode.
