> __**Trio Normal Mode**__

**Initial notes:**
The primary focus of this Trio Normal Mode guide are the strategy responsibilities of the TL5. Most can be applied to a free DPS in 4man or larger teams. To read up on Base and Bomb Tank strategies, check out our Duo Normal Mode guide (reference: #duo).

The responsibilities of the TL5 are to climb in Phase 1 (reference: #climbing), lure Vorago into jump spot and take the 5th Bleed $bleed with provoke $voke on every Bleed set throughout Phase 2 to 4 (reference: #clearing-bleeds).
Always positions farther away from Vorago than the Base Tank and closer than the Bomb Tank (3-4 steps away).  If a Phase is not mentioned on this guide it is because the strategies do not differ from higher team sizes and the TL5 does not have a specific job other than dpsing. Initially, the Base Tank should position near to the northern wall, close to the Phase 1 jump spot. Pre-ultimate at ~ 7 seconds to Target Cycle on time (reference: #target-cycle).

This guide focuses on **Trio Normal Mode** so it will not explain the basics of Vorago, for those go to the **Mechanics** category (reference: #overview).

.Phase 1
> __**Phase 1**__

$maulpiecea Climbing reference: #climbing.

The only difference between Phase 1 in Trios compared to 4 man teams is that the TL5 will receive Blue Bombs $blue during the climb, since the Base Tank initially lures Vorago to the North-West rather than the North-East. This allows the Bomb Tank to focus on dealing damage.

• Use Excalibur $excal on dropdown and Vitality $vitality if you are not doing the Acceleration climb $accel
• Eat to `8,000` HP since you’re getting Blues $blue
• The faster you are, the less damage you take
• Provoke $voke from the appropriate spot when you have reached the final platform
• If Vorago is lured incorrectly, provoke again once the Base Tank took Vorago far enough to the east
• In Trios you should jump under `50,000` HP or right away if there is a Melee Base Tank
• If the TL5 requires more inventory space, the maul piece (a) $maulpiecea should be dropped in the start of Phase 2
• Avoid dropping maul pieces during the phase transition or they will disappear

.Phase 2
> __**Phase 2**__

• Provoke $voke after every 4th Bleed $bleed to take 5th one (reference: #clearing-bleeds)
• Activate all Gravity Fields so Base Tank and Bomb can focus on the other mechanics
• Deal with Red Bombs $red as usual (reference: #cade-cept)
• If you are in charge of dummying $dummy Phase 2, drop it before BHD finishes
• The second maul piece (b) $maulpieceb will appear on the ground after passing BHD (reference: #maul)

.Phase 4
> __**Phase 4**__

• Step into Waterfalls $waterfall and leave them as soon as possible by spam-clicking an ability 
• Position close enough to Vorago to not drag any Blue Bombs $blue
• If receiving a Stone Clone $vitalis, kill it
• Make sure to pick up at pieces as Phase 4 starts or as Phase 2 ends (reference: #maul)
• Provoke $voke after every 4th Bleed $bleed to take 5th one (reference: #clearing-bleeds)
• Off for Reflects $link
• Pick up all maul pieces after the third Waterfall
• If you could not pick up all pieces in time, do it right away as you drop into Phase 5
• If there's a meleer on the team, drop all the pieces by the start of Phase 4 and let them maul instead

.Phase 5
> __**Phase 5**__

The TL5 is expected to do the following for all Phase 5 regardless of the rotation.

• In the start, position in the South-East and deal damage (pre-ultimate)
• Have the maul $maul ready in order to maul as soon as possible (reference: #maul)
• If the Base Tank is meleeing, you must take over switching with the Bomb Tank (reference: #duo - Phase 5 strategies)

.
> __**Weekly Specials (Rotations)**__

Every Wednesday at 00:00 GT (in-game reset), the weekly special rotation changes for Vorago. There are a total of 6 rotations: Ceilings $ceil, Scopulus $scop, Vitalis $vitalis, Green Bomb $green, Team Split $ts and The End $purple. These rotations will affect the mechanics in Phases 3, 4 and 5.

.Ceilings
> __**Ceiling Collapse**__

$ceil Ceilings reference: #ceilings

__Phase 3:__

This phase is FFA-Bomb Tank after Vorago jumps. Since you will be separated from the team, whoever is farther will become the Bomb Tank. This is done to avoid anyone from ditching their ultimates. Be prepared to take Bombs $blue if that happens.

• Pray Magic $deflectmagic if receiving bombs
• Avoid rocks $ceil
• Use Thresholds at the start
• Off for Reflect $link
• Mid rocks should be destroyed (eat above `7,000` HP)
• Position close to Vorago after his second jump and Onslaught $onslaught (make use of your Adrenaline Potion to reach adrenaline for Onslaught), melee uses Berserk $zerk

__Phase 4:__

Destroy rocks according to HP management or if under the effect of cade cept $cade $cept. Maul pieces $maulpiecea $maulpieceb may be stuck beneath rocks. Check your minimap to know where the pieces are located. If you still can not see the maul pieces, move your camera upwards then downwards and they should appear. All maul pieces will appear in Phase 5 at latest.

.
__Phase 5:__

Ceilings $ceil Phase 5 shares the same mechanics and strategies with #team-split $ts. For this reason, this same strategy will appear on the Team Split section below.

• Position in the South-East
• Once the Team Split $ts spawned, activate your Ultimate $zerk $swiftness $sunshine (if TCing: Pre-Ultimate before TS spawn - Reference: #target-cycle)
• After entering a TS, spam-click Vorago to automatically move back in the earliest that Vorago becomes attackable again and re-position yourself correctly in the South-East
• Position closer than the Bomb Tank to not receive any Blue Bombs $blue
• The easiest approach for not dragging Blue Bombs is to tank the first Team Split explosion and stay in your Ultimate in the South-East
• Reprisal $reprisal can be utilized perfectly for the `8,000` typeless hit from a Team Split explosion (need to pick Vorago as active target for Reprisal to deal damage)
• Repeat until Maul $maul

.Scopulus

> __**Scopulus**__

$scop Scopulus reference: #scopulus

__Phase 3:__

Ice Nihils $nihilice and Ripper Demons $ripper will cause Scopulii $scop to randomly change their target. Avoid using these familiars.

• Scopuli target those closest to them or those dealing the most damage to them
• Position at the marked green cross :negative_squared_cross_mark: and DD with the Base Tank
• Pray Melee $deflectmelee
• Provoke $voke immediately if a Scopulus walks towards the Bomb Tank
• To keep their aggression, throw vuln Bombs $vbomb at them and don't provoke $voke unless it's needed
• Devotion $devo once the first Scopulus is about to die
• Prioritize AoE damage

__Phase 5:__

Scopulus $scop Phase 5 shares the same mechanics and strategies with #the-end $purple. For that reason, this same strategy will appear on the The End section below.

• Position in the north-east 1 tile away from melee distance
• You can Onslaught $onslaught on dropdown or pre-Ultimate $zerk $swiftness $sunshine
• If the team is able to push on dropdown, you can Onslaught in MD instead
• Melee Base Tank will go south-east (non-melee Base Tanks usually go north and TL5 south instead)
• Once your Purple Bomb timer hits 5 seconds (reference: #the-end), move to the North-East
• After your Purple Bomb exploded, move back South

.Vitalis
> __**Vitalis**__

$vitalis Vitalis reference: #vitalis

Bringing Dominion Mines $mines is highly recommended for Phases 4 and 5!

__Phase 3:__

• Everyone will pick a corner and be in melee distance
• When you pick a spot, stay away from other players to avoid sharing additional hits
• Since everyone positions in MD, you will receive both melee Swipes $swipe and Blue Bombs $blue

.

• You must prayer flick them in time $deflectmelee $deflectmagic
• During Reflect $link, equip an item via clicking in your inventory or right-click "walk here" right under yourself to stop attacking
• This Phase has Bleeds $bleed after the second cycle (if they happen, voke $voke the 5th one as usual)
• Do not move out of MD at any point during the Phase and __**never**__ go to the Vitalis orb on Phase 3
.

__Phase 4:__

• Position yourself in the north-east quadrant (reference: #vitalis)
• Place Dominion Mines $mines at the correct location where the Vitalis orb is launched
• Step into the Vitalis orb explosion
• Prioritize killing all spawned Vitalii $vitalis right away

__Phase 5:__

As described in the mechanics channel for #vitalis, Vitalii $vitalis occasionally force your active target to switch back to Vorago. This can cause deadly PKs. Be careful your target stays on the Vitalis, and avoid using any AoE abilities if it’s close to Reflect $link.

• Place Dominion Mines close to MD as the Phase starts. Remember to place them again whenever they are off cooldown
• Position in the South-East and pre-Ultimate $zerk $swiftness $sunshine
• When the orb is released, step back, while following the South wall, to step on the Vitalis orb
• Prioritize killing all spawned Vitalii
• After blocking the orb go back to your spot 1-2 steps away from MD and by the south wall

.Green Bomb

> __**Green Bomb**__

$green Green Bomb reference: #green-bomb

__Phase 3:__

• Ultimate on dropdown away from everyone else, but in range to not get Bombs $blue
• Tank all Green Bombs $green targeting you by eating above `10,000` HP or use the Powerburst of Vitality
• Do not accidentally bounce the Green Bomb $green on anyone

__Phase 4:__

• If a Green Bomb is on you, step away from any team members and tank the `10,000`
• You can call if the Bomb $green is on you, so the Bomb Tank can Intercept $cept you to negate the damage from it

__Phase 5:__

• Position yourself South as usual, with the difference that whoever gets the Green $green must run North, tank it and then go back South
• Tank the Green Bomb $green if it’s on you
• The Bomb Tank should be Intercepting $cept whoever gets it, but you should have enough hp (`10,000`) in case this does not happen

.Team Split
> __**Team Split**__

$ts Team Split reference: #team-split

__General Overview:__

• Step into your respective color for each Team Split and go back to your position as soon as possible to avoid dragging Bombs
• This applies to Phases 3 to 5
• Make sure you have at least `8,000` HP if you plan on tanking a Team Split

__Phase 3:__

• Follow Vorago's arms rotating counter-clockwise
• Glitch out of Vorago's arms (reference: #the-end) whenever it is possible and Ultimate during the 3rd quadrant
• If you do not glitch out, pray Mage $deflectmagic and stay in melee distance so you do not get extra damage from the Blue Bombs $blue that are being tagged
