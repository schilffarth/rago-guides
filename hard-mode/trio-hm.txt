> __**Trio Hard Mode**__

Trio Hard Mode is one of the most challenging fights at Vorago. Weekly changing special mechanics, several combat style compositions and an individually varying player skill level - All of this results in the fight being very dynamic and at times extremely difficult.

__General Requirements:__

• Proper gear (T90+ weapons, T80+ power armour, Invention perks)
• The team's Base Tank (melee) is responsible for applying the Statius's Warhammer $swh special attack in all phases
• A base knowledge for approaching Vorago in Hard Mode, all its weekly special attacks and appropriate intuition for occurrences such as random Red Bombs $red
• Intercept $cept (reference: #cade-cept)
• Heal Other $heal (reference: #crack-healing)
• Powerburst of Vitality $vitality (14k entry hit, Green Bomb damage, Team Split damage)

__Recommendations:__

• Seren Godbow $sgb
• A Zaros Godsword $zgs for the Base Tank
• An Eldritch Crossbow $ecb for ranging Bomb Tanks
• Target Cycle (reference: #target-cycle)
• Nihil (even for beginners, refer to #presets)

This Trio Hard Mode Strategy Guide will be separated into roles, combat styles and skill levels. Use pinned Indices to quickly navigate through content sections. Generally speaking, the strategies described can be applied to most, if not all combat style compositions.

Basing Trio Hard Mode is typically performed by a **Melee**. The Base Tank has several responsibilities, the most important being to apply the Statius's Warhammer $swh special attack in **every** phase. Additionally you are expected to properly lure Vorago in phase 1 on the eastern wall so that the Climber (referred to as *Bomb Tank #2*) does not receive any Blue Bombs $blue.

__Required:__

• Statius's Warhammer (stored in an Essence of Finality $eof, you will be using at least 10 SWH specs per kill, this can be very costly otherwise)

__Recommended:__

• Heightened Senses $heightenedsenses (this relic is essential for approaching fast kills with advanced strategies)
• Stalling abilities - Refer to the official Rago Hub spreadsheet for advanced ability damage rotations:
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q7zscYcfJ9qXeIptQmXJiWUloalwDNtmxIOX7bqgkJg/edit?usp=sharing>

.Base Phase 1

> __**Base Tank - Phase 1**__

In phase 1 the Base Tank is responsible for luring Vorago in such a way that the top lure cannot receive Blue Bombs $blue. This also causes the Base Tank to receive Blue Bombs on top of melee Swipes $swipe, therefore pray flicking between melee $deflectmelee and magic $deflectmagic is required. Additionally, when the kill timer reaches ~ 30 seconds, you must bring the boss close enough to the final platform of the climb, from where the Climber will voke $voke Vorago into jump spot.

The easiest way to position correctly in the start is by **standing east of Vorago's spawn location**, tagging the boss, moving **two tiles to the east**, and finally **two tiles to the south**. By moving two tiles east, Vorago is far enough away from the Climber. Moving two tiles south and then attacking the boss causes you to face north-west, enabling the capability of simply surging $surge north-west when it is time to take the boss closer to the Top Lure.

You should surge as the top lure is jumping the last ledge. Continue running to stall Vorago until the Top Lure vokes, then Bladed Dive $bd south. Provoke Vorago, and wait for the Top Lure to jump.

One of the most important aspects of Phase 1 is to pay attention to Vorago's lifepoints - You do not want to deplete it too quickly, as you may accidentally reset the HP. Due to the ease of getting Vorago's HP low enough in time, you will generally have to slow your damage down intentionally before surging.

.Base Phase 2

> __**Base Tank - Phase 2**__

The Base Tank's responsibilities throughout Phase 2 are not any different to basing Normal Mode.

References: #duo, #recenter, #mechanics

.Base Phase 3
> __**Base Tank - Phase 3 Ceilings**__

• (optional, advanced) Use Natural Instinct $natty in the end of Phase 2 (reference: #natty)
• Pre-Ultimate $zerk as you drop into Phase 3
• Drink from your Adrenaline Potion $apot
• Place a Combat Dummy $dummy in the start of the phase
• Apply SWH $swh as soon as possible

Fast teams should simply aim for 0-linking the phase.

If a Reflect $link occurs in this phase, it is best to utilize your Seren Godbow special attack $ingen $sgb shortly after.

For slower teams you may also make use of your Limitless $limitless ability during Berserk.

.Base Phase 4
> __**Base Tank - Phase 4 Scopulus**__

The Base Tank has to lure all Scopuli $scop, in addition to hammering the eastern and northern Scopulus. A frequent usage of Vulnerability bombs $vbomb is very useful for keeping up all Scopuli's stacked and aggressioned towards you, due to vuln bombs dragging Scopulus' aggro.

• Stand directly west of the **western** Scopulus
• Throw a Vulnerability Bomb $vbomb 3 - 4 seconds before Target Cycle to the **eastern** Scopulus's spawn location
• Trow another bomb as soon as possible (after 3 ticks) directly under you in order to drag the **western** Scopulus's aggression
• Attack both southern Scopuli with a few abilities $gbarge > $assault first Scop > $swh second Scop
• As the northern Scopulus comes close enough, target, attack and voke $voke it
• Run directly south by a few tiles and back north, straight through the Scopuli $scop (this should stack the Scopuli next to / on top of each other)

For slower phases you should utilize Devotion $devo and eventually Reflect $reflect.

.Base Phase 5
> __**Base Tank - Phase 5 Vitalis**__

Trio Hard Mode approaches Phase 5 similar to a fast Duo Normal Mode Vitalis Phase 3 (reference: #duo). All players stay in melee distance and must pray flick between melee $deflectmelee and magic $deflectmagic. The Base Tank commonly takes the south-western corner in melee distance to Vorago.

• Pre-Ultimate $zerk as you drop into Phase 5
• Place a Combat Dummy $dummy in the start of the phase
• Apply SWH $swh as soon as possible
• Activate Limitless $limitless for this Berserk

Fast teams should simply aim for 0-linking the phase, just like Phase 3.

If a Reflect $link occurs in this phase, it is best to utilize your Seren Godbow special attack $ingen $sgb shortly after.

.Base Phase 6
> __**Base Tank - Phase 6 Green Bomb**__

At the beginning of the phase, it is recommended to voke $voke Vorago and walk the boss far enough so that you will not be harmed by a mid mist, and can attack vorago from at least two different of the 9 grid arena sections of the arena.

• Apply SWH $swh as soon as possible

On this phase, you will simply be dumping thresholds. On target cycle, release your hammer with a bled assault and continue to thresh.

SGB $sgb can be perfectly implemented in your pre-Reflect $link ability damage rotation.

If you receive a Green Bomb $green, simply drink a sip of your Powerburst of Vitality $vitality in order to easily survive it. If the Green Bomb is not on you, it is an optimal strategy to heal the respective Bomb Tank, shortly after they tanked the `10,000` detonation damage.

.Base Phase 7
> __**Base Tank - Phase 7 Team Split**__

Similar to Phase 6, you will again only be hammering and thresholding.

• Apply SWH $swh as soon as possible (in Target Cycle)
• Reprisal $reprisal the first Team Split if you target cycled

There exist several **advanced** strategies. Based on your preference, you can either utilize your Adrenaline potion $apot during Phase 7 to have adrenaline to Natural Instinct $natty at the end of the phase, or perform a slightly less adrenaline-intensive rotation and save your the Apot for Phase 8.

.Base Phase 8
> __**Base Tank - Phase 8 The End**__

• (optional, advanced) Use Natural Instinct $natty in the end of Phase 7 (reference: #natty)
• Pre-Ultimate $zerk as you drop into Phase 8
• (optional, if available) Drink from your Adrenaline Potion $apot
• Place a Combat Dummy $dummy in the start of the phase
• Apply SWH $swh as soon as possible (on Target Cycle)
• (optional, if available) Activate Limitless $limitless for this Berserk

Fast teams should easily be capable of skipping this phase's Stand Up (reference: #the-end).

If a Stand Up is expectably happening, your team should tag either Red Bombs $red or Blue Bombs $blue, depending on what you agree on. This aspect is a responsibility of your Bomb Tanks and the Base Tank does not have to worry about it.

Drink a sip of the Powerburst of Vitality $vitality a few seconds after Stand Up. Alternatively, your bomb tanks may just choose to Barricade $cade and Intercept $cept on Stand Up, due to the relative ease of 0-linking this phase.

.Base Tips
> __**Base Tank - Tips**__

• The Statius's Warhammer $swh special attack enables all following abilities in that tick cast by yourself with 100% hitchance
• Following advanced ability rotations as provided on the Rago Hub spreadsheet
• This includes pre-Berserk and pre-Barge rotations, or at a highest skill level utilising Darkbow auto attacks for optimal adrenaline gain
• Heightened Senses $heightenedsenses and Fury of the Small $fots cause a drastic improvement for your Berserk $zerk ability rotations, significantly more than Berserker's Fury $berserkersfury would
• Optimizing the usage of Natural Instinct - Reference: #natty
• Remove the Mobile perk $mobile from your armour so that Surge, Escape and Bladed Dive generate adrenaline
• Disruption Shield $disrupt should be used during P2 BHD, end of P3, end of P4 / start of P5, during first TS P7 and before P8 Stand Up
• Greater Fury $gfury the Combat Dummy $dummy in the start of P7 (since you are not pre-Barging)
• Take Crackling $crackling off for Reflects $link and end of P2 / P9

For advanced ability damage rotations, refer to the official Rago Hub spreadsheet:

Bomb Tanking at Trio Hard Mode can be performed in several setups. This section focuses Ranged, covering both Bomb Tank's responsibilities: Bomb Tank #1 and Bomb Tank #2 (the Climber). If you are Ranged bomb tanking with a Hybrid on your team, read up on both this and the Hybrid section. This guide section also covers strategies for approaching Double Ranged bomb tanking in Trio Hard Mode.

__Required:__

• Mechanised Chinchompas $chins for Scopulus Phase 4
• Up to 4 Combat Dummies $dummy

__Recommended:__

• Heightened Senses $heightenedsenses
• Ruby, Onyx and Hydrix bakriminel bolts $rubybolts $onyxbolts $hydrixbolts
• Seren Godbow $sgb and Darkbow $dbow special attacks each stored in an Essence of Finality $eof
• Refer to the official Rago Hub spreadsheet for advanced ability damage rotations:

.Ranged Phase 1

> __**Ranged Bomb Tank - Phase 1**__

It is always recommended to have one Bomb Tank ranging in Trio Hard Mode, who will pre-Ultimate $swiftness start of Phase 1 and deal damage to Vorago, referred to as Bomb Tank #1. The other Bomb Tank is responsible for Climbing and Top Luring $maulpiecea, also referred to as Bomb Tank #2. Refer to #climbing for a detailed breakdown of responsibilities as P1 Top Lure.

A simple Death's Swiftness standard rotation should be enough to bring Vorago's lifepoints low enough before the Climber jumps. Your Ultimate should be placed right in melee distance, west of Vorago's spawn location. This position should provide you 100% uptime of your Ultimate for most locations that Vorago is lured to. Slow down dealing damage as Vorago reaches `50,000` HP and off early enough to avoid a reset.

If the Base Tank receives the second Red Bomb $red (random), you should cast Heal Other $heal to support the Base Tank's food management.

• Phase 1 initial positioning

.Ranged Phase 2

> __**Ranged Bomb Tank - Phase 2**__

The Bomb Tank's responsibilities throughout Phase 2 are not any different to bomb tanking Normal Mode.

Usually the Bomb Tank #2 (the Climber) takes over cade cepting $cade $cept the first and third Red Bomb $red. The Bomb Tank #1 cade cepts the second one.

You should have one person dedicated to shattering $shatter the end of Bring Him Down (preferably the Ranger).

References: #duo, #mechanics

One Bomb Tank is assigned to placing a Combat Dummy $dummy during Bring Him Down.
.Ranged Phase 3

> __**Ranged Bomb Tank - Phase 3 Ceilings**__

• Pre-ECB $ecb
• Dump SGB $sgb and thresholds

Fast teams should simply aim for 0-linking the phase.

If a Reflect $link occurs in this phase, it is highly recommended to utilize Devotion Intercept $devo $cept on the other Bomb Tank.

If your team consists of a Hybrid Bomb Tank, it is very important to voke $voke Vorago as he jumps for the first time.

.Ranged Phase 4
> __**Ranged Bomb Tank - Phase 4 Scopulus**__

Your Base Tank is responsible for stacking all 3 Scopuli $scop. At times though, a Scopulus might reaggro to one of the Bomb Tanks. In this case: **run!** Make sure to stay at the outside of the arena in order to avoid passing any Blue Bombs $blue to your Base Tank.

• (optional, advanced) Use Natural Instinct $natty in the end of Phase 3 (reference: #natty)
• Pre-Ultimate $swiftness as you drop into Phase 4
• BT#1 Devotion Intercept $devo $cept
• Equip Mechanised Chinchompas $chins once the first 2 Scopuli are stacked up
• If available, prioritize using the Darkbow $dbow special attack (stored in EoF $eof) with Chins equipped
• Drink from your Adrenaline Potion $apot after your first Darkbow
• Place a Combat Dummy $dummy in the end of the phase (decide which of your Bomb Tanks)

The BT#1 utilizes Devotion Intercept $devo $cept on the other BT for the second or third Blue Bomb in order to avoid taking too much damage. For slower phases, the other BT#2 should follow it up shortly after the first Devotion runs out. **Do not** use Vulnerability Bombs $vbomb as Bomb Tank throughout Phase 4! The Ranged Bomb Tank should always take the southern position during P4, due to lower attack range of Ranged dual wield compared to Magic.

• Positioning for Bomb Tanks in Phase 4 Scopulus

.Ranged Phase 5

> __**Ranged Bomb Tank - Phase 5 Vitalis**__

Trio Hard Mode approaches Phase 5 similar to a fast Duo Normal Mode Vitalis Phase 3 (reference: #duo). All players stay in melee distance and must pray flick between melee $deflectmelee and magic $deflectmagic. The Bomb Tanks commonly take the north-western corner and the eastern side in melee distance to Vorago.

In the start of the phase, you can position 1 tile out of melee distance, but be ready to step into MD as the Vitalis orb $vitalis explodes in order to avoid getting blocked or lost Line of Sight from spawned Vitali.

• Pre-ECB $ecb
• Dump SGB $sgb and thresholds

Fast teams should simply aim for 0-linking the phase, just like Phase 3.

If a Reflect $link occurs in this phase, it is best to Devotion $devo or Reflect $reflect yourself, although it will mostly be on cooldown if you had a fast Phase 4.

If your team consists of a Hybrid Bomb Tank, it is recommended to voke $voke the start of Phase 5.

.Ranged Phase 6
> __**Ranged Bomb Tank - Phase 6 Green Bomb**__

One Bomb Tank is assigned to placing a Combat Dummy $dummy as you drop into the phase.

• Pre-ECB $ecb
• Dump SGB $sgb and thresholds

Fast teams should simply aim for 0-linking the phase, just like Phases 3 and 5. This phase is significantly easier due to longer time until Reflect $link start.

If you receive a Green Bomb $green, simply drink a sip of your Powerburst of Vitality $vitality in order to easily survive it.

If a Reflect $link occurs in this phase, the Bomb Tank **who did not** receive the Green Bomb should Devotion Intercept $devo $cept the other one. You can also Resonance $resonance the first Blue Bomb after Reflect start safely, even with the caused defensive cooldown by a Green Bomb detonation.

If your team consists of a Hybrid Bomb Tank, it is very important to voke $voke Vorago at the start of Phase 6.

.Ranged Phase 7
> __**Ranged Bomb Tank - Phase 7 Team Split**__

One Bomb Tank is assigned to placing a Combat Dummy $dummy as you drop into the phase.

Following a base guideline of abilities in this phase will significantly improve the overall outcome of Phase 7.

• Tag on Target Cycle $tc with a Snap Shot $snap (quick hitting override required, reference: #ability-travel-speed)
• If you tagged on TC, reprisal $reprisal right away (optional: sip of your Powerburst of Vitality $vitality if ready)
• Activate ECB $ecb special attack on this phase's Combat Dummy $warning Do not target the dummy until you activate Reprisal
• (optional, but recommended) Disruption Shield $disrupt during first the Team Split $ts
• Dump SGB $sgb and thresholds

If your team consists of a Hybrid Bomb Tank, it is very important to voke $voke Vorago immediately after the first Team Split.

.Ranged Phase 8
> __**Ranged Bomb Tank - Phase 8 The End**__

In Phase 8 there exist different strategies (beginner & advanced).

__Beginner (recommended):__

• Dump SGB $sgb and thresholds
• BT#1 tags all Blue Bombs $blue and BT#2 Devotion Intercept $devo $cept (reference: #the-end, #duo)
• Ultimate $swiftness between third and last quadrant
• Utilize your Adrenaline Potion $apot

__Beginner (safe):__

• Dump SGB $sgb and thresholds
• Each Bomb Tank tags 2-3 Red Bombs $red (avoid increased damage by one BT positioning at the outside, the other surging to the following quadrant **asap**)
• BT#1 Ultimate $swiftness between third and last quadrant
• BT#2 Barricade Intercept $cade $cept on Stand Up

.
__Advanced:__

You can dump everything and aim for killing it before the 3rd quadrant. $warning This strategy is only recommended to very experienced teams and highly discouraged to use for beginner - intermediate teams.

If your Death's Swiftness happens to *not* be placed in the first or second quadrant of Vorago's arms, you should move to the second quadrant, even if you have to leave your ultimate for it. Otherwise you are very likely to die due to suffocation damage.

• Use Natural Instinct $natty in the end of Phase 7 (reference: #natty)
• Pre-Ultimate $swiftness as you drop into Phase 8
• Drink from your Adrenaline Potion $apot
• Tag on Target Cycle $tc with a Snap Shot $snap (quick hitting override required, reference: #ability-travel-speed)
• Utilize ECB $ecb and SGB $sgb for first quadrant

.Ranged Tips
> __**Ranged Bomb Tank - Tips**__

• If performing the BT#2 role, transfigure $transfigure for the `14,000` entry hit
• Stalling abilities is sometimes easier by mouse clicking a dummy placed far away from your drop location and far-casting an ability, instead of equipping Excalibur $excal
• Disruption Shield $disrupt should be used during P2 BHD, end of P3, end of P4 / start of P5, during first TS P7, after tagging bombs P8
• Stay MD +1 in the start of P5 $vitalis until Reflect $link
• Take Crackling $crackling off for Reflects and end of P2 / P9
• Remove the armour piece with Mobile $mobile for Escape / Surge / Bladed Dive generating adrenaline
• Heal Other $heal your Base Tank in P1 if they receive the Red Bomb $red and end of P2, P3, P4, P6 and P7
• Rather skip Natty $natty than nattying too late

.Mage Phase 1

> __**Magic Bomb Tank - Phase 1**__

It is always recommended to have one Bomb Tank ranging in Trio Hard Mode, who will pre-Ultimate $swiftness start of Phase 1 and deal damage to Vorago. The other Bomb Tank is responsible for Climbing and Top Luring $maulpiecea, also referred to as Bomb Tank #2.

As Magic Bomb Tank you will most likely be the one climbing in Phase 1. Refer to #climbing for a detailed breakdown of responsibilities.

Yet, if you happen to be the one DPSing, a simple Sunshine $sunshine standard rotation should be enough to bring Vorago's life points low enough before the Climber jumps. Your Ultimate should be placed right in melee distance, west of Vorago's spawn location. This position should provide you 100% uptime of your ultimate for most locations that Vorago is lured to. Slow down dealing damage as Vorago reaches `50,000` HP and off early enough to avoid a reset.

If the Base Tank receives the second Red Bomb $red (random), you should cast Heal Other $heal to support the Base Tank's food management.

.Mage Phase 2

> __**Magic Bomb Tank - Phase 2**__

The Bomb Tank's responsibilities throughout Phase 2 are not any different to bomb tanking Normal Mode.

Usually the Bomb Tank #2 (the Climber) takes over cade cepting $cade $cept the first and third Red Bomb $red. The Bomb Tank #1 cade cepts the second one.

You should have one person dedicated to shattering $shatter the end of Bring Him Down (preferably the Ranger).

References: #duo, #mechanics

One Bomb Tank is assigned to placing a Combat Dummy $dummy during Bring Him Down.

.Mage Phase 3
> __**Magic Bomb Tank - Phase 3 Ceilings**__

• (optional, advanced) Use Natural Instinct $natty in the end of Phase 2 (reference: #natty)
• Pre-Ultimate $sun in the center of Phase 3
• Drink your Adrenaline Potion $apot
• (BT #1) Devotion Intercept $devo $cept start of Reflect $link
• Detonate $detonate and SGB $ingen $sgb post-Reflect

Fast teams should simply aim for 0-linking the phase. Executing a stable Metamorphosis $metamorphosis ability damage rotation will increase the consistency of 0-linking Phase 3.

If your team consists of a Hybrid Bomb Tank, it is very important to voke $voke Vorago as he jumps for the first time.

.Mage Phase 4
> __**Magic Bomb Tank - Phase 4 Scopulus**__

Your Base Tank is responsible for stacking all 3 Scopuli $scop. At times though, a Scopulus might reaggro to one of the Bomb Tanks. In this case: **run!** Make sure to stay at the outside of the arena in order to avoid passing any Blue Bombs $blue to your Base Tank.

• Pre-ultimate $sunshine as you drop into Phase 4
• (BT #1) Devotion Intercept $devo $cept
• If Greater Chain $gchain is unlocked, follow it up with a Guthix Staff $gstaff special attack early in the phase (the Greater Chain buff applies the Guthix Staff affinity stacks and defence drain to all targets)
• Prioritize AOE damaging abilities and 4taa
• Detonate as soon as all 3 Scopuli are stacked up
Place a Combat Dummy $dummy in the end of the phase (decide which of your Bomb Tanks)

The Bomb Tank #1 utilizes Devotion Intercept $devo $cept on the other BT for the second or third Blue Bomb in order to avoid taking too much damage. For slower phases, the other BT#2 should follow it up shortly after the first Devotion runs out. **Do not** use Vulnerability Bombs $vbomb as Bomb Tank throughout Phase 4! If you 0-linked Phase 3, your Sunshine $sunshine will be on cooldown for Scopulus. Simply dump Thresholds and Guthix Staff special attacks.

.Mage Phase 5

> __**Magic Bomb Tank - Phase 5 Vitalis**__

Trio Hard Mode approaches Phase 5 similar to a fast Duo Normal Mode Vitalis Phase 3 (reference: #duo). All players stay in melee distance and must pray flick for melee swipes $swipe and Blue Bombs $blue. The Bomb Tanks commonly take the north-western corner and the eastern side in melee distance to Vorago.

In the start of the phase, you can position 1 tile out of melee distance, but be ready to step into MD as the Vitalis orb $vitalis explodes in order to avoid getting blocked or lost Line of Sight from spawned Vitali.

• Pre-Detonate $detonate
• Dump Thresholds

Fast teams should simply aim for 0-linking the phase, just like Phase 3.

If a Reflect $link occurs in this phase, it is best to Devotion $devo or Reflect $reflect yourself, although it will mostly be on cooldown if you had a fast Phase 4.

.Mage Phase 6
> __**Magic Bomb Tank - Phase 6 Green Bomb**__

One Bomb Tank is assigned to placing a Combat Dummy $dummy as you drop into the phase.

• (optional, advanced) Use Natural Instinct $natty in the end of Phase 5 (reference: #natty)
• Pre-Ultimate $sunshine start of Phase 3
• Drink your Adrenaline Potion $apot
• Pre-Detonate $detonate and make use of SGB $ingen $sgb pre-Reflect $link
• (BT #1) Devotion Intercept $devo $cept start of Reflect

Fast teams should simply aim for 0-linking the phase, just like Phases 3 and 5. This phase is significantly easier due to longer time until Reflect $link start. If you are going for fast phases, you should skip your Apot $apot in this phase and save it for Phase 8 instead.

If you receive a Green Bomb $green, simply drink a sip of your Powerburst of Vitality $vitality in order to easily survive it.

If a Reflect $link occurs in this phase, the Bomb Tank **who did not** receive the Green Bomb should Devotion Intercept $devo $cept the other one. You can also Resonance $resonance the first Blue Bomb after Reflect start safely, even with the caused defensive cooldown by a Green Bomb detonation.

If your team consists of a Hybrid Bomb Tank, it is very important to voke $voke Vorago at the start of Phase 6.

.Mage Phase 7
> __**Magic Bomb Tank - Phase 7 Team Split**__

One Bomb Tank is assigned to placing a Combat Dummy $dummy as you drop into the phase.

Following a base guideline of abilities in this phase will significantly improve the overall outcome of Phase 7.

• Pre-Detonate $detonate and tag on Target Cycle $tc
• If you tagged on TC, reprisal $reprisal right away (optional: sip of your Powerburst of Vitality $vitality if ready)
• (optional, but recommended) Disruption Shield $disrupt during first the Team Split $ts
• Dump thresholds

If your team consists of a Hybrid Bomb Tank, it is very important to voke $voke Vorago immediately after the first Team Split.

.Mage Phase 8
> __**Magic Bomb Tank - Phase 8 The End**__

In Phase 8 there exist different strategies (beginner & advanced).

__Beginner (recommended):__

• Dump thresholds
• BT#1 tags all Blue Bombs $blue and BT#2 Devotion Intercept $devo $cept (reference: #the-end, #duo)
• Ultimate $sunshine between third and last quadrant
• Utilize your Adrenaline Potion $apot

__Beginner (safe):__

• Dump thresholds
• Each Bomb Tank tags 2-3 Red Bombs $red (avoid increased damage by one BT positioning at the outside, the other surging to the following quadrant **asap**)
• BT#1 ultimate $sunshine between third and last quadrant
• BT#2 Barricade Intercept $cade $cept on Stand Up

.
__Advanced:__

You can dump everything and aim for killing it before the 3rd quadrant. $warning This strategy is only recommended to very experienced teams and highly discouraged to use for beginner - intermediate teams.

• Pre-Metamorphosis $metamorphosis as you drop into Phase 8 (drink from your Adrenaline Potion $apot)
• Pre-Detonate $detonate and tag on Target Cycle $tc
• Release a stalled Wild Magic with a 2hit Asphyxiate, followed up by an SGB spec (your Ingenuity of Humans $ingen will eventually be on cooldown from Phase 6, refer to #sgb-without-ioth)

.Mage Tips
> __**Magic Bomb Tank - Tips**__

• Detonate $detonate should be pre-charged in most phases, as charging it during Reflects $link would cause Detonate to be on cooldown for the following phase
• Use Barrage as primary spell, Blitz might be nulled by Reflect (also Phase 4 Scopulus benefits heavily from Barrage)

A general Hybrid setup for Trio HM consists of Melee $attack as primary and either Ranged $ranged or Magic $magic as secondary combat style. Magic is recommended due to the naturally increased hitchance on Scopuli $scop. At the current unbalanced state of combat styles, there exists only one method of making Hybrid effective over a double Ranged Bomb Tank setup. Hybridding is only recommended if your goal is improved kill speed, as your team is a lot more likely to lose a kill.

It is highly discouraged to take a BoB familiar (Mammoth scrolls with Soups $soup), due to the lost accuracy from a Nihil familiar already making Ranged a better choice over Hybrid. Therefore a Hybrid setup ends up having a very small amount of food (1 - 3 inventory slots). The selected aura should be Berserker $berserker.

In phases 1, 2, 4 (Scopulus $scop) and 9 the Hybrid Bomb Tank uses the secondary combat style, Ranged or Magic.

Throughout phases 3 - 8 (excluding Scopulus P4) Melee is to be used. A primary portion of these phases will require you (the Hybridder) and the Base Tank to **step under** Vorago (reference: #stepping-under), with the BT#1 voking $voke the boss.

Depending on the outcome of your Phase 10, you will either camp Melee for the start of Phase 11 or switch to your secondary combat style immediately during phase transition.

As Hybrid Bomb Tank you will be the one climbing in Phase 1. Refer to #climbing for a detailed breakdown of responsibilities.

.Hybrid Phase 1

> __**Hybrid Bomb Tank - Phase 1**__

Generally speaking, a Hybrid Bomb Tank takes over the BT#2 responsibilities. The other Bomb Tank #1 ultimates Phase 1 while the Hybridder climbs. Refer to #climbing for a detailed breakdown of responsibilities.

Equip your secondary combat style for the Phase 1 to allow for tagging from the final platform of the Top Lure.

.Hybrid Phase 2
> __**Hybrid Bomb Tank - Phase 2**__

The Bomb Tank's responsibilities throughout Phase 2 are not any different to bomb tanking Normal Mode.

Usually the Bomb Tank #2 (the Climber) takes over cade cepting $cade $cept the first and third Red Bomb $red. The Bomb Tank #1 cade cepts the second one.

You should have one person dedicated to shattering $shatter the end of Bring Him Down (preferably the Ranger).

References: #duo, #mechanics

Due to lacking inventory space as a Hybridder, it is recommended to have either the Base Tank or the Bomb Tank #1 take an additional Combat Dummy $dummy. One Bomb Tank is assigned to placing a Combat Dummy $dummy during Bring Him Down (preferably the BT#1).

.Hybrid Phase 3
> __**Hybrid Bomb Tank - Phase 3 Ceilings**__

• Use Natural Instinct $natty in the end of Phase 2 (reference: #natty)
• Pre-ultimate $zerk as you drop into Phase 3
• SGB $ingen $sgb post-Reflect $link

Your team should simply aim for 0-linking the phase. It is very important for the Bomb Tank #1 to voke $voke Vorago as he jumps away.

.Hybrid Phase 4
> __**Hybrid Bomb Tank - Phase 4 Scopulus**__

Your Base Tank is responsible for stacking all 3 Scopuli $scop. At times though, a Scopulus might reaggro to one of the Bomb Tanks. In this case: **run!** Make sure to stay at the outside of the arena in order to avoid passing any Blue Bombs $blue to your Base Tank.

• Pre-ultimate $sunshine as you drop into Phase 4
• Prioritize AOE damaging abilities and 4taa
• Detonate as soon as all 3 Scopuli are stacked up
• Utilize Limitless $limitless for this Sunshine

Place a Combat Dummy $dummy in the end of the phase (preferably the BT#1).

The Bomb Tank #1 utilizes Devotion Intercept $devo $cept for the second or third Blue Bomb in order to avoid taking too much damage. For slower phases, the Hybridder should follow it up shortly after the first Devotion runs out. **Do not** use Vulnerability Bombs $vbomb as Bomb Tank throughout Phase 4!

.Hybrid Phase 5

> __**Hybrid Bomb Tank - Phase 5 Vitalis**__

Trio Hard Mode approaches Phase 5 similar to a fast Duo Normal Mode Vitalis Phase 3 (reference: #duo). All players stay in melee distance and must pray flick for melee swipes $swipe and Blue Bombs $blue. The Hybridder commonly takes the north-western corner in melee distance to Vorago, with the BT#1 standing on the east side (opposite of L-Rock).

• Pre-ultimate $zerk as you drop into Phase 5
• Drink from your Adrenaline Potion $apot

Fast teams should simply aim for 0-linking the phase, just like Phase 3.

If a Reflect $link occurs in this phase, it is best to utilize your Seren Godbow special attack $ingen $sgb shortly after.

It is recommended to have your team's Bomb Tank #1 voke $voke Vorago throughout Phase 5 in order to allow for both the Base Tank and the Hybridder to step under from the opposite side.

.Hybrid Phase 6
> __**Hybrid Bomb Tank - Phase 6 Green Bomb**__

• ZGS spec $zgs as you drop into Phase 6
• Implement an SGB spec $ingen $sgb in your P6 ability rotation pre-Reflect $link

If the Hybridder or the Base Tank receive a Green Bomb $green, it will be bridged multiple times. A 0-link in this phase is basically guaranteed.

It is recommended to have your team's Bomb Tank #1 voke $voke Vorago throughout Phase 6 in order to allow for both the Base Tank and the Hybridder to step under.

.Hybrid Phase 7
> __**Hybrid Bomb Tank - Phase 7 Team Split**__

• Pre-ultimate $zerk shortly before Target Cycle (optimally 2 GCDs prior, to allow for a stalled basic released with another basic on TC)
• Utilize Limitless $limitless for this Berserk

It is recommended to have your team's Bomb Tank #1 voke $voke Vorago immediately after the first Team Split $ts in order to allow for both the Base Tank and the Hybridder to step under.

.Hybrid Phase 8
> __**Hybrid Bomb Tank - Phase 8 The End**__

• Dump thresholds (pre-Barge $gbarge with Mobile $mobile to allow for a double Greater Barge rotation)
• SGB spec $sgb in the first quadrant (reference: #sgb-without-ioth)

If a Stand Up is expected to happen, have the other Bomb Tank #1 tag all Red Bombs and then Barricade Intercept $cade $cept on stand. The Hybridder should pre-Ultimate $zerk for Stand Up.

.Hybrid Tips
> __**Hybrid Bomb Tank - Tips & Tricks**__

• Transfigure $transfigure for the 14k entry hit
• DBow autos
• Disruption Shield $disrupt should be used during P2 BHD, end of P3, end of P4 / start of P5 and during first TS P7
• Step under for phases 5, 6 and 7 (reference: #stepping-under)
• Take Crackling $crackling off for Reflects and end of P2 / P9
• Do not use the Mobile perk $mobile on your armour directly and put it on your Excalibur $excal instead
• Heal Other $heal end of phases P3, P4, P6 and P7
• Rather skip Natty $natty than nattying too late

.Weekly Special Mechanics

> __**Weekly Special Mechanics**__

This section was written by <@191388421548146689>, <@300296497277173761> and <@316175818458136588>.

For a general overview of weekly Special Mechanics and their effect on phases 9, 10 and 11 refer to #phase-overview and the respective channels: #ceilings, #scopulus, #vitalis, #green-bomb, #team-split and #the-end.

Trio Hard Mode approaches Phase 9 similar to Duo / Trio Normal Mode Phase 4 (reference: #duo). The person barricading $cade last on P9 should be the person that does **not** barricade start of P10.

Phases 10 and 11 vary the most, relying on the same factors as described in the intro to this Trio Hard Mode guide: Weekly changing special mechanics, several combat style compositions and an individually varying player skill level. This section of the guide will cover 2 basic guidelines of strategies for differently approaching phases 10 and 11.

These strategies are categorized as:

• Safe: A stable order of Ultimates and Barricades for consistently finishing a Trio Hard Mode kill fast with safe strategies
• Advanced: Follow the Rago Hub spreadsheet ability damage rotations (<https://discordapp.com/channels/670983760178839572/802162163686572082/802165372047458305>)

.Safety
> __**Safety**__

__Phase 10:__

• Base Tank and Bomb Tank #1 Ultimate $zerk $swiftness $sunshine start of Phase 10
• Bomb Tank #2 Barricade Intercept $cade $cept timings
    - $ceil **Ceilings / $ts Team Split:** First auto attack after Team Split
    - $scop **Scopulus / $purple The End:** Third auto attack
    - $vitalis **Vitalis:** First auto attack or before Vitalis orb explosion (depending on what happens first)
    - $green **Green Bomb:** Barricade only if the Green Bomb targets someone else (Vitality $vitality if on BT#2)

For optimal Phase 10 maul $maul timings, refer to the respective weekly mechanic channel: #ceilings, #scopulus, #vitalis, #green-bomb, #team-split or #the-end.

• Alternative maul timings
.
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/676485011268042761/802173025252016128/maulguide.PNG
.

If you miss the optimal opportunity of mauling, continue through Vorago's mechanics and maul at alternative maul timings, as stated in the weekly mechanic channels. If you go through another whole cycle of mechanics, the Bomb Tank #1 cade cepts $cade $cept at the same time as the BT#2 did in the start of P10.

One of the Bomb Tanks is usually assigned to placing a Combat Dummy $dummy in the end of Phase 10 (shortly before maul). This dummy must be placed in the east and you have to be distanced at least 1 tile to the southern wall. The Base Tank should **always** maul with a prior cast Shield Dome $dome!

Ranged Bomb Tanks should apply BSA $bsa throughout phases 10 and 11 to compensate for decreased hitchance once the Base Tank's SWH $swh spec runs out.

.
__Phase 11:__

• Base Tank Ultimate $zerk whenever it is ready
• Bomb Tanks switch Barricade Intercept $cade $cept and Ultimates $swiftness $sunshine rotationally

Bomb Tanks cade cept / ultimate timings assume BT#2 caded last on Phase 10:

$ceil **Ceilings**

• BT#1 cade cept either after Team Split $ts or start of Reflect $link
• BT#2 ultimate and thresh, build to cade cept for the second Team Split throughout P11

$scop **Scopulus**

• BT#1 cade cept either the third auto attack after Purple Bomb $purple release or start of Reflect $link
• BT#2 ultimate and thresh, build to cade cept for the second cycle of Purple Bomb / Reflect throughout P11

$vitalis **Vitalis**

• BT#1 cade cept either the first auto attack after Bleeds $bleed or the Vitalis orb $vitalis explosion
• BT#2 ultimate and thresh, build to cade cept for the second cycle of Bleeds

.
$green **Green Bomb**

• BT#1 cade cept once the Green Bomb $green chose its target (if a Bomb Tank is targeted and neither cade cept nor Vitality $vitality is available, the Base Tank should cade cept or the other Bomb Tank utilizes Devotion Intercept $devo $cept)
• Rotationally repeat cade cepts for every Green Bomb and keep track of cooldowns (Vitality, Barricade, Devotion)

$ts **Team Split**

• BT#1 cade cept after Team Split $ts or start of Reflect $link
• BT#2 ultimate and thresh, build to cade cept for the second Team Split throughout P11

$purple **The End**

• BT#1 cade cept either start of Reflect $link or the Vitalis orb $vitalis explosion
• BT#2 ultimate and thresh, build to cade cept for the second Reflect

.Advanced
> __**Advanced**__

Approaching phases 10 and 11 in advanced teams is independent of weekly mechanics.

In Phase 10 you always aim for 0-speccing (get to maul $maul before the spec release, e.g. Purple Bomb $purple or Vitalis orb $vitalis). This is achieved by pushing consecutively every 3 ticks for 8 tiles from Target Cycle on. Refer to #zero-linking for a detailed explanation on Vorago's push and overflow mechanic. Once you reached maul spot, you wait for the spec to release and maul right after.

If Phase 10 was executed correctly, Phase 11 should always start with 3 auto attacks (5 if first P10 spec is Green Bomb $green or Purple Bomb $purple) into the second spec of P11.

• Optimal execution of P10 / 11 ability rotations
