Proper placement of dummies is necessary in kills to ensure that the dummy does not harm the phase.
A misplaced dummy can cause difficulties when it comes to properly targeting Vorago.
Understanding how to place dummies properly allows for an easier time taking advantage of it (for example, using it to far stall).

This guide will reference far stalling multiple times (reference: #stalling-abilities), as it’s what defines dummy placement. If no one in the team is taking advantage of far stalling, you may place phase 2, 3 and 4 dummies South-West.

Additionally, for Phase 5 Normal Mode (Phase 10 Hard Mode), weeks that start with Team Split might not benefit much from a dummy unless you are going for a zero link (reference: #zero-linking). In that case it depends on the team.

As a last note, always avoid placing dummies close to the walls or corners, make sure it’s in the middle of the respective quadrant.

__Dropdown mechanics:__
One player at random will drop South-West (the "default" drop), and all other players will fall close to their position at the end of the previous phase.
For example, if you drop the Phase 2 dummy North, and both stay near the dummy, one person will drop South-West, and the other will drop North.

Typically, if someone has to place their ultimate (except Berserker) on a phase then they should not be placing that phase's dummy.
Dummies have been labeled as “Bomb Tank” or “Base Tank” in the guide. For Hard Mode, BT dummies can be placed by either of the Bomb Tanks or a DPS.

.Hard Mode

> __**Hard Mode**__

Hard mode dummies follow roughly the same idea as Normal Mode dummies. However, you will generally place dummies South-West because with more people you can’t guarantee dropdown positions, making it less consistent to far stall when depending on spawn.
It is not currently standard to use Face or Phase 1 dummies, however if you decide to bring them, they follow the same rules as Normal Mode.
Face, phase 1, 2 and 9 follow the same rules as their Normal Mode relatives (Phase 9 HM is Phase 4 NM).

$scop __Phase 4 (Scopulus):__

• Placed by: Bomb Tank
• Position: Where you are standing / South-West
• Timing: Phase end
• Notes: You can drop the dummy when the first Scopuli dies if the damage is good. Otherwise wait until there is one left

$maul __Phase 11:__

• Placed by: Bomb Tank
• Position: Use it while in Melee Distance, while making sure you are standing North
• Timing: When close to maul spot, before mauling
• Notes: Not dropping dummy while North can cause the dummy to not spawn. Surge before placing the dummy if necessary - if you are too far back, the dummy will be unreachable at the start of P11
