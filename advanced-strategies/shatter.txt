> __**Shatter**__

After unlocking the Storm Shards & Shatter abilities $shard $shatter from the Mazcab ability codex, it is a commonly used strategy to apply as many storm shards $shard as possible during Phase 2 and 4 to then use Shatter $shatter as you passed Bring Him Down or after the third waterfall $waterfall to trigger all stacked shards and kill Vorago in the first possible tick.

> __**Bring Him Down example rotations**__

Using Shatter as a slow hitting ability (Range $ranged without fast hitting overrides or Mage $magic from 5+ tiles) will allow you to Shatter 1 tick earlier.
BHD has a duration, counting from the first GCD of the damage check, of 20 ticks / 12 seconds in **Normal Mode** and 13 ticks / 7.8 seconds in **Hard Mode**. Example rotations:

$blue __Normal Mode:__

**Mage:** $wm $cblast ➔ $barrage $asphyx 4hit ➔ $dbreath ➔ $barrage $shatter

**Melee:** $gbarge ➔ 4tick $assault ➔ $deci ➔ $sever ➔ $cleave ➔ $gfury ➔ $shatter

**Range:** $sgb ➔ $rapid 5hit ➔ $snipe (4t) ➔ $snap ➔ $needle ➔ $shatter

.
$red __Hard Mode:__

**Mage:** $wm ➔ $dbreath ➔ $barrage $sonic ➔ $shatter

**Melee:** $gbarge ➔ $destroy ➔ $cleave ➔ $deci ➔ $shatter
